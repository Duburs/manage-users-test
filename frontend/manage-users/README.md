# ManageUsers
A simple Angular application to manage users. The application allows to add, edit, delete and view users.

The folder structure is as follows:
- src/app/components: Contains all in theory reuseable components used in the application.
- src/app/services: Contains all the global services used in the application.
- src/app/routes: Contains all the routes and their views.

There are some limited unit tests in the dropdown component.

You should be able to deploy the application simply using `npm run ci`.

## Development server

Run `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
